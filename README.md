# ðŸ“¸ Face Recognition Using Python

A real-time face recognition system built with **Python**, **OpenCV**, and the **face_recognition** library.

It detects and recognizes faces from a webcam stream, labels known faces, and marks unknown ones.

## âœ¨ Features
âœ… Real-time face detection from webcam  
âœ… Recognizes faces from stored images in `faces/` folder  
âœ… Draws bounding boxes & labels  
âœ… Works with `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, and `.jfif` images

## ðŸ–¼ How It Works
- Encodes all known faces from the faces/ folder.
- Captures frames from the webcam in real-time.
- Detects faces within each frame using the face_recognition library.
- Compares detected faces against stored encodings.
- Labels recognized faces with their names and draws bounding boxes.
- Marks unrecognized faces as "Unknown".

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
 - ðŸ’¡ Good lighting greatly improves detection accuracy.
 - ðŸ“· Use high-resolution, clear, front-facing images for best results.
 - ðŸ–¼ Keep one face per image in the faces/ folder for more accurate recognition.
 - âš¡ Processing speed depends on your systemâ€™s CPU/GPU performance.
